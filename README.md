> **Sophisticated AI-powered incident response orchestration platform that automates incident triage, runbook execution, code analysis, and remediation through intelligent multi-agent coordination using LangGraph, RAG, and advanced workflow automation.**

## 🎯 Executive Summary

OpsBridge revolutionizes incident response by bridging the gap between detection and resolution through intelligent AI orchestration. This enterprise-grade platform addresses the critical fragmentation in incident management workflows by providing a unified, auditable path from incident detection to resolution, with special focus on code-related incidents and deployment issues.

### 🏆 Key Achievements
- **End-to-End Automation**: Complete incident lifecycle management from triage to resolution
- **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Automated diff analysis and deployment correlation
- **RAG-Enhanced Knowledge**: Local runbook retrieval and execution planning
- **Safety-First Design**: Dry-run by default with strict allowlists and audit trails
- **Production-Ready**: Docker containerized with FastAPI and comprehensive monitoring

## 🚨 The Problem We Solve

Teams consistently hit the same walls during incidents:

1. **Noisy Logs**: On-call gets paged, logs are overwhelming, and you're guessing where to look first
2. **Stale Runbooks**: Documentation exists but is scattered, outdated, or written for last year's version
3. **Tool Fragmentation**: Jumping between tools to pull diffs, run linters, check style guides, and decide rollback vs. hotfix
4. **Risky Execution**: Even when you know what to do, you need guardrails against destructive commands
5. **Post-Incident Paperwork**: After the fire is out, someone still needs to write comprehensive incident reports

**This fragmentation is why incidents take longer than they should.** Most teams already have the parts (logs, runbooks, repos, CI, wikis). The missing piece is the intelligent glue that guides you through a clean, auditable path—especially when incidents are caused by recent code changes.

## 🏗️ How OpsBridge Works

OpsBridge stitches the incident response flow together using a sophisticated agent-to-agent pipeline:

## 🔬 Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent State Management
```python
class IRState(TypedDict, total=False):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    incident: Dict[str, Any]                    # Incident metadata
    signals: List[Dict[str, Any]]               # Extracted log signals
    hypotheses: List[str]                       # AI-generated hypotheses
    plan: List[Dict[str, Any]]                  # Remediation plan
    actions: List[Dict[str, Any]]               # Executed actions
    approvals: Dict[str, bool]                  # Approval status
    diff: str                                   # Code changes
    review: Dict[str, Any]                      # Code review results
    policy_violations: List[str]                # Policy violations
    done: bool                                  # Completion status
    round: int                                  # Iteration counter
```

### RAG-Enhanced Knowledge Retrieval
```python
class LocalRetriever:
    def __init__(self, persist_path='rag/store/index.pkl', 
                 corpus_meta_path='rag/store/corpus.json'):
        # Load TF-IDF vectorizer and corpus
        with open(persist_path,'rb') as f: obj = pickle.load(f)
        self.X = obj['X']; self.vec = obj['vocab']
        with open(corpus_meta_path,'r',encoding='utf-8') as f: 
            self.corpus = json.load(f)
    
    def search(self, query: str, k: int=3) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # Semantic search across runbooks and documentation
        q = self.vec.transform([query])
        scores = (q @ self.X.T).toarray().ravel()
        idx = np.argsort(scores)[::-1][:k]
        return [{'source': self.corpus[i]['source'], 
                'score': float(scores[i]), 
                'text': self.corpus[i]['text'][:1200]} for i in idx]
```

### Safety-First Execution
```python
def commander_node(approve: bool=False):
    def _run(state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        plan = state.get("plan") or []
        actions: List[Dict[str, Any]] = state.get("actions") or []

        # Safety check: require approval for execution
        if not state.get("approvals", {}).get("approved") and not approve:
            # Generate preview report without execution
            report_path = write_incident(state)
            return {"messages": [{"type": "ai", "content": 
                    f"Dry-run completed. Report: {report_path}"}], 
                    "actions": actions, "done": True}

        # Execute allowlisted commands with verification
        for step in plan:
            if step.get("cmd"):
                out = safe_shell(step["cmd"], approve=approve)
                record = {"step": step, "out": out}
                
                # Perform verification if specified
                if step.get("verify"):
                    v = safe_shell(step["verify"], approve=approve)
                    record["verify"] = v
                actions.append(record)

        return {"actions": actions, "done": True}
    return _run
```

## 🔒 Safety & Security

### Built-in Safety Features
- **Dry-Run by Default**: All operations are safe by default, requiring explicit approval
- **Strict Allowlists**: Only pre-approved commands can be executed
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action logging with sensitive data redaction
- **Policy Validation**: Multi-layer safety checks before any execution
- **Verification Steps**: Automatic verification after each remediation action

### Security Considerations
- **Data Redaction**: Sensitive information automatically redacted from logs
- **Approval Workflows**: Human oversight for all critical operations
- **Isolated Execution**: Commands run in controlled environments
- **Compliance Ready**: Audit trails suitable for regulatory requirements

> ⚠️ **Note**: The current policy guard is a demonstration stub. For production use, implement comprehensive policy validation with your organization's specific requirements.
